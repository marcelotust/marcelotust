- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcelotust
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology, inovation and games.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently recycling my coding skills because I am without write code lines since 6 years ago. I was a Senior Flash Developer (Action Script 2.0).
- ğŸ¤“ Now I am learning about some game engines which use Typescript as Phaser 3.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me on Twitter as @marcelotust
